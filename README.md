🧠 NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis
A guided hands-on project to build a sentiment classification model using NLP techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier. This project was completed via Coursera’s Rhyme platform under the guidance of Dr. Ryan Ahmed.

📌 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze Twitter data to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to apply core NLP preprocessing steps and implement a Naive Bayes classifier to perform text classification.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Import and explore Twitter sentiment dataset using Python libraries

Perform EDA and visualize tweet distributions

Clean and preprocess tweet text (punctuation, stop words)

Apply Count Vectorization for tokenization

Understand the theory behind Naive Bayes classifiers

Train and evaluate a text classification model

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Naive Bayes, Pipeline)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
